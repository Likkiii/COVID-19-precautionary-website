			Hello! I'm Likhit Ajeesh, a fresher from CSE Core. I have an year of experience in CS. During my 12th, I have done C++ programming & DBMS-MySQL.
			After joining VIT, I have done some basics of Python programming too. Now, I would love to enhance my coding and programme/web development skills in a 
			perfect environment like yours and I'm looking forward to interact with lots of like minded people out there to develop myself and help others too.
